\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First and foremost, I want to thank Henry Westphal, my supervisor.
His experience in designing digital circuits and his prior works in creating model \glspl{CPU} were very valuable in creating the \gls{EDiC}.
Henry Westphal especially helped by copying the schematic to OrCAD, helping with the layout and in general had very beneficial advices for the thesis.

Furthermore, many friends and fellow students -- namely Anton Schulte, Jasper v. Blankenburg and Leonard Hackel -- deserve my special thanks for their invaluable support, both academic and personal.

Most importantly, I am very grateful for all the support I received from my parents, my brother and especially my girlfriend, Nele Heindorf.
