\chapter{Hardware Design}\label{cha:hardware}
After the \gls{FPGA} behavioral simulation has been successful, the hardware design process is started.
The initial step is designing a schematic (\cref{sec:sch}) which is followed by the netlist simulation and the placing and routing of components and wires in \cref{sec:pr}.
Additionally, a timing analysis is performed to ensure that the clock frequency is as high as it is possible without risking any misbehavior.

\section{Schematic}\label{sec:sch}
The full schematics of the hardware design can be found in \cref{cha:schem} in \cref{fig:schPC,fig:schRAM,fig:schMC,fig:schClk,fig:schIO,fig:schReg,fig:schAlu}.
The schematic is created in such a way that the logical connections are easy to understand.
Each \gls{IC} has its pins arranged for easy understanding and the connections have meaningful names to easier understand the logic.

The 74 series of \glspl{IC} is used for the \gls{EDiC}.
However, a lot of decisions need to be made in choosing the correct \glspl{IC} as explained in detail below.
\subsection{Register Comparison}
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{ce.png}
  \caption{Clock Enable circuit of the \emph{74F825} \gls{IC} \cite{74f825}.}
  \label{fig:clockEnable}
\end{figure}
The 74 series of logic \glspl{IC} feature many registers.
The most basic register \gls{IC} has $n$ D-type flip-flops with respective data inputs and outputs plus one common clock input.
On each rising edge of the clock the flip-flops capture the input values and hold them until the next rising edge of the clock.
However, often it is required that a register does not capture data on every rising edge of the clock.
This is done with an additional input, called \emph{clock enable}.
Implementing the clock enable with a basic AND gate of the clock and a control bit has the major drawback that glitches of the enable control signal can propagate to the clock input of the register and, therefore, falsely trigger the register.
Additionally, every logic gate has a propagation latency which would result in a clock signal being delayed at some \glspl{IC} which, in turn, may lead to timing problems.
There are two widely used alternatives to the simple AND gate:
The enable input can be used as the select input for a multiplexer to the data input of the flip-flop, where it multiplexes between the actual input and the current output.
This allows the flip-flop to always capture data but when the enable input is inactive, it recaptures the current output.
The drawbacks are that each bit of the register needs a multiplexer at the input and, furthermore, that the flip-flops draw power on every clock pulse, even though no new data is captured.
The \emph{74F825} logic \gls{IC} solves this with the circuit shown in \cref{fig:clockEnable}.
When the $\overline{\text{EN}}$ input is low, the NAND gate on the right negates the CP\footnote{The internal flip-flops of the \emph{74F825} are negative edge triggered}.
When the $\overline{\text{EN}}$ input is high, on the other hand, the output does not change.
This circuit prevents the $\overline{\text{EN}}$ to trigger a falling edge (which would trigger the flip-flops) on the CP output.
However, when the $\overline{\text{EN}}$ goes high while the CP input is high, then the output also goes high.
This is not directly a problem because the flip-flops only trigger on falling edges but is the reason for timing requirements on the $\overline{\text{EN}}$ input which are discussed in more detail in \cref{sec:timing}.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[height=7.5cm]{DFlipFlop.pdf}
    \subcaption{Classical D-type flip-flop built out of three $\overline{\text{SR}}$ NAND latches \cite{DFlipFlop}.}
  \end{subfigure}%
  \hspace{.05\textwidth}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[height=7.5cm]{DFlipFlopClearSet.pdf}
    \subcaption{D-type flip-flop modified to support $\overline{\text{Clear}}$ and $\overline{\text{Set}}$ \cite{DFlipFlopClearSet}.}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Comparison of D-type flip-flops with and without $\overline{\text{Clear}}$ and $\overline{\text{Set}}$.}
  \label{fig:clearSet}
\end{figure}

As the registers store the current state of execution, it is required that the registers start up to a known state.
Therefore, some registers feature an asynchronous clear input (or set input) which forces all flip-flops to 0 (or 1).
This is usually accomplished by modifying the classical D-type flip-flop to allow for setting and resetting the internal $\overline{\text{SR}}$ NAND latches as shown in \cref{fig:clearSet}.

A third feature that may be important is a tri-state output which allows the register to be directly connected to a bus.
It is accomplished by adding a tri-state output driver to the outputs of the flip-flops.

The register that was chosen for the \gls{EDiC} is the \emph{74F825} because it has all three features and is 8 bits wide.
However, three other kinds of registers are also sparsely used in the \gls{EDiC}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \emph{74AS867} is a more advanced synchronous counter register which is used for the \gls{PC} and \gls{SP}. They are described below.
  \item The \emph{74F374} register only features the output enable and is used once where no additional control logic is required.
  \item The \emph{74F273} is used for the built-in I/O to mimic the typical asynchronous extension cards and for the buffering of user control inputs (stepping etc.) because only a reset is required there.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{LED Driver}\label{sec:ledBuffer}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ledDriver.pdf}
  \caption{The \gls{LED} connection of the main bus with the \emph{74ABT540} as a driver.}
  \label{fig:ledDriver}
\end{figure}
The \gls{EDiC} features many \glspl{LED} showing the register contents to aid the understanding of the workings of a \gls{CPU}.
However, naively connecting the \glspl{LED} to the logic outputs of registers may lead to unwanted behavior because the outputs of all logic \glspl{IC} have a limited current they can provide.
This leads to the usage of specific buffers for the \glspl{LED}.
Additionally, the current rating usually is higher for low-level output due to the internal workings of the output buffer. % as explained in \cref{sec:outputBuffer}.
For example, the B outputs of a \emph{74F245} non-inverting buffer are rated for maximum \qty{-15}{\milli\ampere} for high-level output and \qty{64}{\milli\ampere} for a low-level output \cite{74f245}.
Therefore, connecting the anode of a \gls{LED} via a current limiting resistor to the output of a non-inverting buffer and the cathode to GND will not be ideal.
To be able to draw more current from the buffer and thus having brighter \glspl{LED}, inverting buffers are used, and the \glspl{LED} are connected ``backwards'' as shown in \cref{fig:ledDriver}.
The \emph{74ABT540} is the \gls{IC} used as \gls{LED} buffer in the \gls{EDiC} with a low-level current rating of \qty{64}{\milli\ampere} \cite{74abt540}.
The cathodes of the \glspl{LED} are then connected to the \emph{74ABT540} and the anodes are connected through current limiting resistors to $V_{cc}$.

\subsection{Program Counter \& Instruction \glsxtrshortpl{EEPROM}}
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{schemPC.pdf}
  \caption{The inputs of the \gls{PC} to enable incrementing, branching and returning from functions.}
  \label{fig:schemPC}
\end{figure}
\Cref{fig:schPC} contains the \gls{PC} (U54 and U55) with the instruction \glspl{EEPROM} (U62, U67, U69) and the registers to store the instruction.
The \gls{PC} can be incremented or loaded from either an instruction immediate (U50 and U52) for branching or the \gls{SRAM} (U49 and U51) for returning from a function call, visualized in \cref{fig:schemPC}.
To facilitate these operations, the \emph{74AS867} is used which is an 8 bit synchronous counter with loading and asynchronous clear capabilities that can be cascaded with a ripple carry output.
The \gls{PC} is then used as the address to the instruction \glspl{EEPROM} and can also be saved to the \glspl{SRAM}.
As the main memory is only 8 bits wide but the \gls{PC} is 16 bit wide, a second \gls{SRAM} \gls{IC} is used to store the upper bits of the \gls{PC} in the case of a function call (see \cref{sec:schMemory}).
The \gls{PC} is, additionally, used as A inputs to the \emph{74F521} (U53 and U60) comparators to detect when a breakpoint is reached.
The 8 bit comparators can be cascaded via the enable input to compare 16 bit values.
The B input is selected by the user with four hexadecimal digit switches.

The function of the ``Test'' block between the output of the instruction \glspl{EEPROM} and the instruction registers is explained in \cref{sec:testAdapter}.
For understanding the function of the schematic, it can be assumed that it shorts the connections on the left with the corresponding connections on the right.
The lowest of the 3 instruction registers (U64) holds the instruction code which is used in the \cref{sec:schControl}.
The upper two registers (U70 and U71) hold the immediate value which can be used as an address in the \cref{sec:schMemory}, as a branch address for the \gls{PC} and the lower 8 bits can be used as immediate value on the bus (U75).

All 5 registers have \glspl{LED} connected to them as described in \cref{sec:ledBuffer}.
\subsection{Memory}\label{sec:schMemory}
The memory module (\cref{fig:schRAM}) features three registers used for the address logic:
The \gls{MAR} (U68 and U63) is a 16 bit register where the lower and upper 8 bits can be loaded independently of the bus.
The \gls{SP} (U56) is a \emph{74AS867} counter register similar to the \gls{PC} but only 8 bits wide and wired differently to only allow incrementing and decrementing.
The three different kinds of memory accesses are decoded from the upper 8 address bits which either come from the instruction immediate (U74) or the \gls{MAR} (U73):
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{I/O access:} When the upper 8 bits equal \texttt{0xfe} (U79), the I/O \gls{CE} signal is asserted and the \gls{SRAM} \gls{CE} is deasserted.
  \item \emph{Stack access:} When the upper 8 bits equal \texttt{0xff} (U76), the stack memory is selected.
        Then the upper 8 bits of the address is replaced by the \gls{SP} and a 17th address bit is asserted to access the stack memory.
\end{itemize}
The address is then driven by several bus drivers according to the decoding logic (U61, U63, U65, U66 and U72).

The actual \gls{SRAM} \glspl{IC} (U77 and U100) have voltage levels which are not quite compatible with the standard \emph{74F} \glspl{IC} \cite{AS6C4008} which is why all the signals connecting to them are buffered with the \emph{74ACT245} \cite{74act245} (U201, U202, U203, U204 and U205).

\subsection{Control Logic}\label{sec:schControl}
\Cref{fig:schMC} contains two registers for the address of the microcode \glspl{EEPROM} (U85, U86 and U87) of which the data pins are the control signals (\cref{sec:controlSignals}).
The first registers (U83) is used as a synchronous 3 bit step counter which increments each cycle except when the halt signal is asserted.
The instruction finished control signal will reset the step counter to 0 at the next cycle.
U83 also registers the four \gls{ALU} flags and U84 registers the instruction to synchronize all address bits for the \glspl{EEPROM}.

\subsection{Clock and Reset}\label{sec:schClock}
\Cref{fig:schClk} contains the oscillator (X1) whose frequency is determined in \cref{sec:timing} and an active low reset controller (U34) which resets on power-on and can be combined with a user reset switch (SW1301).
The clock and reset is buffered with an \emph{74ABT245} for minimal latency.
To avoid glitches (see \cref{sec:switchGlitch}) on the four user inputs, a low pass and a Schmitt trigger and two registers are used.
A multiplexer (U39) generates the halt signal from the debug user inputs and the instruction finished control signal to implement the logic described in \cref{sec:clock}

\subsection{Built-In I/O}
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{schemBasicIO.pdf}
  \caption{The basic \gls{IO} included in the \gls{EDiC} with one register and one 8 bit display.}
  \label{fig:schBasicIO}
\end{figure}
The built-in I/O (\cref{fig:schBasicIO,fig:schIO}) consists of one register to hold the output value (U92) which is connected to two hexadecimal displays (U93 and U94).
For input two hexadecimal switches (SW10 and SW11) are used with a bus driver (U91).
To control the register clock pulse and the output enable of the bus driver, the I/O \gls{CE} is combined with the I/O write enable and I/O output enable and the I/O address is compared with \texttt{0x00} (U88).

\subsection{Register Set and \glsxtrshort{ALU} output}
The register set in \cref{fig:schReg} consists of two registers (U40 and U41) which can be loaded from the bus.
The register outputs can drive the bus (U44 and U45) and are multiplexed for the A input of the \gls{ALU} (U42 and U43).
After the combinatorial \gls{ALU} (\cref{sec:schALU}), the four operation results are multiplexed (U5, U6, U7 and U8) and stored in the \gls{ALU} output register (U9).
Even though the \gls{ALU} output register features output enable inputs, an individual bus driver is used (U10) because the content of the \gls{ALU} output register should be displayed to the user (U11).
The carry flags are also multiplexed (U101) as the carry flag from the shift operation is generated independently.
The overflow flag is generated in the combinatorial schematic of the \gls{ALU}, the negative flag is just the \gls{MSB} of the output and the zero flag is deduced from a comparison with zero (U12).
All four flags are then stored in a register (U97).
\subsection{Combinatorial \glsxtrshort{ALU}}\label{sec:schALU}
\Cref{fig:schAlu} shows the ripple carry adder on the left composed out of 8 full-adder and with subtracting capabilities.
The barrel shifter on the right side is explained in depth in \cref{sec:alu}.
The carry flag resulting from a shift operation should always represent the last bit which was shifted out of the 8 bits and should be unchanged when shifting by 0.
This is accomplished with another multiplexer (U102).

\section{Placing and Routing}\label{sec:pr}
After designing the schematic all the components need to be placed on the \gls{PCB}.
All logic \glspl{IC} are listed in \cref{tab:cpuIcs}.
For placing and routing several factors are important.
As the goal of the \gls{EDiC} is to be easy to understand for future students, all components were not only placed to optimize the wiring, but a focus was to place components of the same modules close together.
Additionally, extra space was left to mark each module and to name all the \glspl{LED} on the silkscreen of the \gls{PCB} for easier reference.
\Cref{fig:pr} is a rendering showing the traces (red and green), silkscreen (violet) and through-holes/vias (green/yellow).

Especially on larger \glspl{PCB} and designs with quickly switching power consumption it is important to ensure good power delivery to all components.
In the case of the \gls{EDiC} this is achieved by using a 4-layer \gls{PCB} with the two internals layers being filled with GND and 5V planes.
The top and bottom layer are then used for logical connections where the most efficient wiring can be done when one layer mostly has vertical wires (red traces in \cref{fig:pr}) and the other layer mostly horizontal wires (green traces).

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{magneticField1.pdf}
  \caption{The magnetic field resulting from two wires of \qty{1}{\milli\meter} thickness with \qty{50}{\milli\ampere} of current flowing opposite directions.
  For the blue plot, the centers of the two wires are \qty{20}{\milli\meter} apart and for the orange only \qty{1}{\milli\meter}. \cite[page 187]{Albach2011_1}}
  \label{fig:HField}
\end{figure}
The usual problem when not using solid GND planes is the implicit low pass filter resulting from the inductance.
When using dedicated GND wires to all the \glspl{IC} the current flows through one trace towards the \gls{IC} and through another trace back to the source.
This leads to an electric field around both traces which in turn may induce current in neighboring traces and most importantly stores energy and acts as an $RL$-low-pass.
If one would reduce the space between those traces until those traces are directly beneath each other, the electrical field would be minimal.
\Cref{fig:HField} demonstrates this by visualizing the H-field around two wires in two scenarios.
The blue plot assumes the two wires to be \qty{20}{\milli\meter} apart (at 40 and \qty{60}{\milli\meter}) and it can be seen that the opposite current flow leads to an amplified magnetic field between the two wires and also a magnetic field to the left and right of the wires.
However, when moving the wires closer together, the magnetic field in between the two wires vanishes and the field to the left and right is reduced by a lot because the positive field to the right of the left wire cancels the negative field to the right of the right wire.
In the extreme case of both wires being perfectly aligned in this dimension (being on top of each other for example), the magnetic field would cancel out completely.

This is exactly what is accomplished by using a GND plane:
Assuming a trace takes a 90-degree turn to reach the \gls{IC} and then the current flows through the GND plane back to the source.
The current on the GND plane could flow everywhere on the plane, especially the direct (diagonal) path with the least resistance or the path directly under the trace which has the least inductive reactance because the magnetic field is a lot smaller.
The overall impedance is defined in \cref{eq:impedance} where the capacitive reactance ($X_C$) can be ignored in our case.
The inductive impedance, on the other hand, is dependent on the frequency and the inductance. \cite[page 45]{Albach2011_2}
\begin{eqnarray}
  Z=R+j(X_L+X_C)\label{eq:impedance}\\
  Z=R+j(2\pi fL+X_C)
\end{eqnarray}
Thus, for higher frequencies, the inductance has a greater impact on the overall impedance and the current in the GND plane will flow closer to the trace to reduce the inductive reactance.
For lower frequencies, the inductive reactance becomes negligible and the lower resistance of the direct (diagonal) path prevails.

Another important factor to bear in mind is to route the traces in a way that makes it possible to access every trace on the \gls{PCB}.
It is always possible that some bug was not detected in the schematic design or netlist simulation.
If a bug has been found it may be required to cut a trace and rewire it (see \cref{cha:eval}).
Therefore, logical wires are always placed on the top or bottom plane and on the top plane traces will never be completely covered by \glspl{IC}.
If, for example, connecting pins 1 and 24 of a 24 pin \gls{IC} (they are directly opposite of each other) they should not be connected directly but a detour should be taken to expose the trace from under the \gls{IC}.

It is also possible that a new \gls{IC} needs to be placed on the \gls{PCB} to fix a bug, like an extra register or bus driver.
Therefore, through holes are provided to allow spare \glspl{IC} to be placed at convenient locations throughout the \gls{PCB}.

The final assembly of the \gls{EDiC} including the two test adapter boards is shown in \cref{fig:EDiC_TestAdapter}.

\section{Timing Analysis}\label{sec:timing}
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{timingExample.pdf}
  \caption{Timing relations for a combinatorial datapath between two registers.}
  \label{fig:timingExample}
\end{figure}
To figure out what the maximum frequency is at which the \gls{EDiC} can operate on, a detailed timing analysis was performed.
The timing analysis computes the path with the longest propagation delay which is called the critical path.
The delay of the critical path can then be used as a baseline for choosing the correct frequency.

\Cref{fig:timingExample} visualizes how the propagation delays work:
Each \gls{IC} has delays which are specified in the datasheet.
In the example of \cref{fig:timingExample}, a value of register $r_0$ goes through a combinatorial path and is then stored in register $r_1$.
The registers have a propagation delay $t_p$ which specifies the time from a rising edge of the clock to the output (Q).
In theory, it is also important to hold the input data of a register for the specified hold delay $t_h$, however, in the \gls{EDiC} this is no problem.
Then the combinatorial path also has propagation delays from inputs to outputs which need to be added up ($t_c$).
At the next register, a setup time $t_s$ has to be met which specifies the amount of time the input data needs to be stable before the rising edge.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{all_cycles.pdf}
  \caption{Timing analysis for the control signals.}
  \label{fig:timingControl}
\end{figure}
The \cref{fig:timingControl,fig:timingRam,fig:timingAlu} show three timing analysis for the \gls{EDiC}.
Each block represents one \gls{IC} with the corresponding delay.
The first row shows the unit number from the schematic, the second line the type of \gls{IC}, the third shows the kind of delay and the fourth shows the amount of time.
The kind of delay of a buffer can for example be d$\rightarrow$ q which means input data to output data delay or oe$\rightarrow$ q which is the time from asserting output enable until the data is valid.
The delay time is always the worst case time as specified in the datasheet\footnote{Propagation typically varies with the temperature and age of the \gls{IC} and by taking the worst case time (maximum) it is assured that no timing bugs occur due to e.g. temperature changes.}.
A vertical double line represents a point where multiple delay paths must be met until the execution can continue.
In \cref{fig:timingControl} for example, the propagation delay of register U83 (flags and step register) and register U84 (instruction) must both be over until the address for the \glspl{EEPROM} U85, U86 and U87 are valid.
At these points the maximum of the merging delay paths is used as the starting point for the next path.
The maximum delay up to this point is also printed at the top.
Additionally, some paths are labeled for clarity.
All the delays of the critical path (the path that takes the longest from one starting point to one end point) are marked in red.

\Cref{fig:timingControl} shows the basic latency path for control signals and the common bus driver \glspl{IC}.
The latencies inside the register set and program counter are negligible and, therefore, only the memory module with the complex address decoding and the \gls{ALU} is further examined.
For the memory module (\cref{fig:timingRam}), there are two critical paths:
The first comes from the \texttt{memInstrToRamAddr} control signal, through the stack selection logic to the memory address and finally to the buffered output data of the \gls{SRAM} on the bus (\qty{281.3}{\nano\second}).
The second has the same origin but represents the writing option of the \gls{SRAM} (\qty{272.2}{\nano\second}).

The \gls{ALU} latency path (\cref{fig:timingAlu}) is more complex which is mainly due to the ripple carry adder.
Consequently, the critical path comes from the bus, through all the carry flags to the final adder result.
After the result multiplexer the longest path is from the zero flag to the \gls{ALU} flag register U97 (\qty{313.9}{\nano\second}).

Theoretically, it is possible for one instruction to read a value from the \gls{SRAM} and using it in the same instruction as an input to the \gls{ALU}.
This would replace the baseline delay of the bus input in \cref{fig:timingAlu} (\qty{169.5}{\nano\second}) with \qty{281.3}{\nano\second} and, therefore, enlarge the total worst case latency to
\begin{equation}
  \qty{281.3}{\nano\second}-\qty{169.5}{\nano\second}+\qty{313.9}{\nano\second}=\qty{425.7}{\nano\second}\label{eq:latency}
\end{equation}
Notwithstanding, because the \gls{EDiC} is a multicycle \gls{CPU} it is easily possible to assign two cycles to all \gls{ALU} operations where the B operand is read from the memory.
With this trick, the overall critical path is the maximum of \qty{313.9}{\nano\second} and $\nicefrac{\qty{425.7}{\nano\second}}{2}$ which is \qty{313.9}{\nano\second}.
With a safety margin of 30\% it is feasible to choose an oscillator with a frequency of \qty{2.4}{\mega\hertz}:
\begin{equation}
  \qty{2.4}{\mega\hertz}\leq\frac{1}{1.3\cdot\qty{313.9}{\nano\second}} =\qty{2.45}{\mega\hertz}
\end{equation}

When dealing with circuits that are designed to run right at the critical path or with very long trace lengths another factor needs to be taken into account which is neglected here.
Each signal has a latency in traces and when the clock arrives at the second register earlier than at the first register, the time allowed for the combinatorial path is shorter than the theoretical clock period.
However, for the \gls{EDiC} this is not a problem as shown in \cref{sec:eval_clock}.
