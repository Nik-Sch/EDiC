2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock inst_clk5Mhz/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock i_clk100 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk5_clk_wiz_5Mhz and i_clk100 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk5_clk_wiz_5Mhz] -to [get_clocks i_clk100]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks i_clk100 and clk5_clk_wiz_5Mhz are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks i_clk100] -to [get_clocks clk5_clk_wiz_5Mhz]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk5_clk_wiz_5Mhz and i_clk100 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk5_clk_wiz_5Mhz] -to [get_clocks i_clk100]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks i_clk100 and clk5_clk_wiz_5Mhz are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks i_clk100] -to [get_clocks clk5_clk_wiz_5Mhz]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT inst_memory_i_32 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock inst_clk5Mhz/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin inst_clk5Mhz/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk5_clk_wiz_5Mhz and i_clk100 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#2 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks i_clk100 and clk5_clk_wiz_5Mhz are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-1#1 Warning
Runtime intensive exceptions  
The following constraint contains more than 10000 objects. To preserve runtime and memory performance, it is recommended to include minimum number of objects. Check whether this list can be simplified.
-from = expands to 16618 design objects.
